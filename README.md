Project Title: Jitters Coffee Shop Database Management System

Description: This project involved designing and implementing a robust database management system for Jitters, a rapidly growing coffee shop in New York City. The system was created to streamline Jitters' customer ordering and inventory management processes, addressing the operational challenges posed by its expansion.

Key components of the project included:

Database Design: Created a foundational relational database using MySQL and a NoSQL database using MongoDB. This system tracks customer information, orders, payment methods, and inventory levels.
Data Modeling: Developed Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to capture the relationships between key entities, which were then mapped to relational and NoSQL database schemas.
Data Population & Analytics: Populated the database with sample data using Python scripts and performed various SQL queries to retrieve business-critical insights such as order history, payment method usage, and inventory stock levels. MongoDB queries were also implemented for NoSQL operations.
Python Integration: Leveraged Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize key metrics such as customer order frequency, inventory levels, and payment methods. The database is fully accessible via Python, enabling advanced analytics and business insights.
Future Work: The project leaves room for scalability, with the possibility of integrating additional business branches and automating inventory procurement through advanced SQL and NoSQL queries.
Tech Stack: MySQL, MongoDB, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Role: Co-designer and developer of the database system, focusing on both the relational and NoSQL implementations, data population scripts, and analytical queries.
